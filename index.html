  <p align=left>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. 
  Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.
  Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.
  Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.
  Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.</p>
  <p align=right>- Calvin Coolidge</p>
