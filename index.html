title: Patience, persistence, determination
---
<p align=left>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. 
Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.
Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.
Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.
Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.</p>
