Today I arrived in the the United Kingdom, I have finally gotten around to launching a blog.  Starting over in a new country is exciting, and there is so much that I could include in a blog.  It may change in time, but I intend to limit it's scope to hobbies, and a new woodwork workshop in particular.  At the moment, I don't have much of a woodwork workshop, and I have very limited woodworking skill, but I will change all of that.  As things stand right now, the sum total of my workshop is an empty garage, and the minimal set of tools that I brought over in my luggage. Quite a bit more is packed in the container that will hopefully arrive in six to eight weeks, but all I have right now is: 

* hammer;
* flat and philips screwdrivers;
* number 13 and 10 spanners;
* pair of pliers; and
* retractable-blade utility knife.  
 
The blog itself is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the entire setup on [Github Pages](https://github.com) has been done using a six-year-old netbook, free wi-fi at a local coffee shop, and a web browser.
