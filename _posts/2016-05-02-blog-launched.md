Today I arrived in the the United Kingdom, I have finally gotten around to launching a blog.  It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the entire setup has been done with only a web-browser and free wi-fi from a local coffee shop. 

Starting over in a new country is exciting, and there is so much that I could include in a blog.  It may change in time, but I intend to limit it's scope to hobbies, and a new woodwork workshop in particular.  At the moment, I don't have much of a woodwork workshop, and I have very limited woodworking skill, but I will change all of that.  As things stand right now, the sum total of my workshop is an empty garage, and the minimal set of tools that I brought over in my luggage: 

* hammer;
* flat and philips screwdrivers;
* number 13 and 10 spanners;
* pair of pliers; and
* retractable-blade utility knife.  
 
Quite a bit more is packed in the boxes that will hopefully arrive in six to eight weeks, but this is all I have right now.
