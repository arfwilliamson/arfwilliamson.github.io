title: Sharpening stone

This weekend I thought a lot about the workbench, but didn't actually build anything. My
only accomplishment was to unpack the boxes and find all my wood-working tools.  That
makes it sound like I have lots of tools, but really I don't.  Anyhow, I unpacked what I
have, and thought about what I will need to do to make a workbench, and decided that 
sharpening up the chisels would be a good thing to do.

My chisels have actually never been sharpened.  Each of them was bought, used until it was 
blunt, and put into the tool-box.  A couple of them I tried to sharpen with an angle-grinder,
but all I achieved was to overheat the steel and get the bevels out of shape.  That isn't
something I want to repeat, but if they are a bit messed-up, then they would be good to
experiment on.  So I watched lots of YouTube videos hoping to find the right way to sharpen 
chisels, and discovered that the world is full of crazy people who want to shave with their
chisels and believe that spending hundreds of pounds on fancy sharpening systems for cheap
chisels is a good investment.  For me, that amount of money buys twenty or thirty new chisels,
which would keep me stocked for a decade at least.  So instead, I bought a three pound 
combination stone from the local hardware store, and a tin of 3-in-1 oil, and tried to 
discover some sharpening skills.

It took up the whole weekend, but I now have some nice sharp chisels.  They aren't razor 
sharp, but they cut wood well, and that is all they need to do.  The process I used is 
quite simple:

1. Flatten the back, grinding across the chisel, parallel to the edge. I 
didn't realise how badly forged some of the chisels were until I did this.
All I wanted was a flat back on the edge and sides, and that comes up 
quickly with the coarser side of the stone.  After the back is flat, some
light grinding with the finer side makes it look a bit nicer, but I'm not
sure its actually necessary.
2. Shape the bevels, holding the chisel at a constant angle, and still
grinding parallel to the edge.  Keep grinding until the bevel is uniform 
and the edge is square to the sides.  You can check this against the light
with a combination- or framing-square.  The trick here is that you don't 
need a perfectly flat stone to get a uniform bevel if you grid parallel 
to the edge.  I don't know why it works, but if you hold the bevel flat
on the stone and grind the full length of the stone, then the unevenness
in the bevel gets ground nice and flat.
3. Now sharpen the edge, grinding away from it, starting at a shallow
angle (handle close to the stone) and increasing the angle from the start
to the finish of each stoke.  This creates a slightly-rounded bevel, which 
is as strong as the single-angle, micro-bevelled edge that all the fancy 
systems try to achieve, but it is much easier to do freehand.
4. Finally, flatten the back again, to dress the edge properly. It only 
takes a few strokes, and you will see a narrow, polished strip all along 
the edge. Literally, it is a fraction of a millimeter, but you can see it 
clearly when the edge is properly dressed.  I didn't use bevel-guides, or 
rubbing blocks, or leather strops, and I still got sharp, useable edges.

Sharpening is slow, but quite therapeutic. It can easily become work-avoiding
behaviour, though.  I really do need to make some progess on the workbench over 
the next couple of weekends.
