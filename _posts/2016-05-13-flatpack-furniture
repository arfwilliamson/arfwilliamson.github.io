While I was at work today, several boxes of flatpack furniture were delivered.  On opening
the boxes, Cathy was a little distressed to find out that the boxes include no tools, and
tools are definitely needed to assemble the furniture.  It was precisely for this reason
that I packed a minimal set of tools in my luggage.  With those tools, all the panels were
edge-jointed, the backing sheet was nailed down, and the drawer-runners installed.  So, to 
anyone migrating, don't pack all your tools into boxes and ship them.  Pack a few that you 
might need in your luggage, so that they are available as soon as you land.

The concealed fastening system that has been invented for flatpack furniture made from veneered 
chipboard panels is very ingenious, but I have noticed that they are not for sale in any of 
the DIY shops, which is a bit frustrating.  If I need to make something myself, I will have 
to rely on my tried and trusted method of screws into the panel ends, with woodfiller to cover 
the heads if necessary.  It doesn't look as neat, but it is certainly strong.  Mind you, I'm 
not planning to make chipboard furniture from scratch.  Ikea and Argos do that cheaply enough.
