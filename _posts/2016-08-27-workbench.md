While perhaps not an absolute necessity, because I have done plenty of work on kitchen floors and lawns,
a workbench is definitely very nice to have.  Blogs and YouTube pages seem to deal with workbenches a
lot, so evidently there is a lot of interest in the subject.  While the information and opinions are
absolutely fascinating, they are confusing in their complexity and scope, and many give the impression
that a sturdy, well-outfitted workbench is the ultimate woodworker's status symbol. For me, though, a 
workbench is a means to an end, and not an end in itself.  I would rather spend my money and time making 
things for the house than making my workbench.  So, knowing that other people will differ, my requirements 
for my workbench are:

* sturdy enough for clamping, sawing, planing, chiselling and drilling;
* made from cheap, readily-available timber; and
* easy and quick to make with a minimum of tools.

Having watched some of the YouTube videos and read some of the blogs, I decided that I just need to 
jump in, design it quickly, and build it without any further delay.  First, the design concept:

* 90cm high, because that matchs the height of my table saw;
* about 60cm wide, because that is about as far as I can reach; 
* about 1.5m long, because I can move that around; and
* as simple as possible, but not simpler than that!

Next, I decided on the materials.  63mm x 38mm x 2440 timber studs seem to be the cheapest timber 
available, coming in at less than £2-00 each. I bought fifteen of them - five at a time, because 
that was as much as I could carry on my shoulders.  To join them together, I bought forty 60mm x 
4mm screws for another £2-00.

And finally, the construction details.  First, I made two tresles 34 1/2" high, 24" wide, notched 
at the top to take the front and back planks.  I put the narrow side of the studs to the front and 
back, because that made the joints stronger.   So I cut 5' off of twelve of the studs, which gives 
enough lengths for the top, front and back, and the eight tresle pieces come out of the off-cuts. 

The bottom rails are joined to the legs with half-lapped, half-dovetail joints to make it sturdy and 
prevent racking. These joints were easy and quick to cut with the table saw and tenon saw.

The top rail is just a plain half-lapped joint, and the rail in 1 1/2" shorter because of the notches
for the front and back planks.  I fixed those with half-dovetail joints too, but in the end they were
not as sturdy as I wanted, and I had to add a diagonal brace.  There will be more about that later.  
The slot in the front and back planks doesn't go all the way through to the top, so it had to be cut 
with a chisel.  That was the only tricky part of the whole build.

The work surface is made from eight studs that are screwed onto the rails.  I recessed the screws, so 
that I can flatten the top later.  Astute readers will have noticed that eight 2 1/2" studs, and two 
1 1/2" front and back planks is only 23", and I made the trestles 24" wide.  There is, therefore, a 1" 
gap that was filled by ripping a 1" wide strip from one of the studs.  

Having built the bench, I decided that it wasn't as sturdy in the long direction as I wanted, and the
work-surface flexed a bit too much.  To fix these, I made two modifications.  First, I used two of 
the offcuts, from the studs used to make the front and back planks, for extra rails under the top.  
Then I used the last two offcut to make diagonal braces on the front, with lap joint onto the tresle 
legs and bird's-mouth joints onto the extra rails that I had just added.  

Then I played on the bench with sawing, planing, drilling, and hammering for several hours.  I enjoyed
that a lot, but realised that a workbench needs to be more than a table.  I added some holes and pegs 
to the front plank, and a crochet, and a mortise for a planing stop.  All of those were quick to do, 
and cost nothing.  A vice on the front would be really nice, but it will be expensive, so it will have
to wait for a bit.  Some sort of support for wide boards would also be nice.

A total material cost of less than £30, and a build time of about four hours.  It's not a classical 
heirloom piece, but it is sturdy and easy-to-build out of readily available materials.  I am pleased 
with my finished workbench.
