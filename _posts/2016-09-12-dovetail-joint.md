Tonight I made my first dovetail joint.  Craftsmen and critics will notice the gaps
and inaccuracies, but the panels fit together tightly and I don't think they will
come apart easily.  With practice, I will definitely learn how to be more precise
with the sawing and chisel work, and the gaps will become smaller, but this is a 
strong joint notwithstanding the inaccuracies.  I still have three more to do for 
the box, and then four smaller joints for the lid, so my chest is probably still 
several weeks in the making, but the wooden chest project is progressing.

Since this is my first joint, I decided to use larger pins, because they would be 
easier to cut and hopefully a bit more forgiving. Certainly 1/4" pins cut cleanly 
by an experienced craftsman look very neat, but I am certainly not experienced 
and did not expect to cut the pins cleanly at the first attempt.  In the end, I 
settled on 1/2" pins (at the narrow end) and 1" tails (at the wide end), so my 
14" wide boards have ten pins and nine tails to join them.

I decided that the pins should be on the ends of the box, to resist pull-out from
the handles.  So the long boards will have the tails, and the first job was to
mark and cut these.  To mark the tails, I made a guage using the pattern in
'Modern Practical Joinery' by George Ellis (published 1908), which I have on the
bookshelf, but can't remember buying.  The angle is 1:6 because the wood is soft 
and several bloggers wrote "1:6 for softwoods, 1:8 for hardwoods".  Having marked
the tails, I clamped the tail-board to the front of the workbench and cut them 
using the tenon saw.  I think this would have been easier and more precise with a 
finer saw, but the tenon saw is the finest one I have, so it had to do.  By the 
time my wooden chest is finished, I might want to go out and buy a dovetail saw, 
I think. I chopped out the pin-holes using a chisel, and this too was a little 
imprecise. More practice is definitely needed, and another three joints for the 
box and four for the lid will hopefully provide that.

Marking and cutting the pins was a bit tricky, because the boards are quite 
unwieldy.  In the end, I clamped the pin-board to the front of the bench, with 
the edge 2 1/2" above the bench top.  I put a scrap of 2 1/2" x 1 1/2" timber 
stud on the bench and rested the tail-board on that and the pin-board.  With 
this arrangement, the tail-board is firm and steady under it's own weight, and 
I had both hands free to line up the two boards and mark the pins.  Again, the
tenon saw wasn't as precise as I would have liked, but I managed to cut every
pin the the line.  Chopping out the waste was a bit messy, but I got cleaner
and quicker as I progressed.  

The moment of truth was fitting the two boards together, and they did fit together.
It was a tight fit in places, and a bit looser in others, but it really felt 
good to see two panels joined at an almost perfect right angle.  Certainly the
individual tails and pins are inaccurately cut, but all of them working together
makes a strong joint that accommodates those inaccuracies.  There is something
quite poetic in that.
