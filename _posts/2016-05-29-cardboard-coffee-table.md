Today I decided to use what little materials and tools I have to make something.  
Making things is good for the soul, and I needed to overcome some of the frustration 
caused by the long delivery time for the container from South Africa.

Ikea have graciously provided me with a large supply or reasonably-strong corrugated
cardboard.  I added a cheap, steel ruler and a hot-glue gun to my set of tools, and then 
made this little cardboard coffee table.  It might not look like much, but it did me good 
to make it.
