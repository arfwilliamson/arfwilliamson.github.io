title: Garden table

Fresh from making the cardboard coffee table, I made a garden table from real wood today.  
With the budget still very constrained, and considering that this is really a stop-gap item, 
expensive timber was absolutely out of the question.  I used cheap fencing slats and galvanised
nails only.  The design has to be worked out in the shop to minimise waste and expenditure, 
but I think I did a reasonably good job.  The design is really simple.  It is a slatted top
nailed into two bearers on edge, with flat legs nailed to the ends of the bearers and to top.
By choosing dimensions carefully, the off-cuts from the top can be used for the bearers and
legs.

I did need to add a saw to my minimal tool kit.  A square would have been useful too, but
there is a steel framing square amongst the tools that are being shipped over, so I didn't
want to waste money on another one.  Instead I marked and cut as precise a right-angle as I 
could out of corrugated cardboard left over from the coffee table.  It is temporary, but I
only need it for a few weeks.
