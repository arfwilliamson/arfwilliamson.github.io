title: Dovetail joint

Tonight I made my first dovetail joint.  Craftsmen and critics may notice the gaps
and inaccuracies, but the panels fit together tightly and I don't think they will
come apart easily.  With practice, I will definitely learn how to be more precise
with the sawing and chisel work, and the gaps will become smaller, but notwithstanding
those, this is a strong joint.  I still have three more to do for the box, and then 
four smaller joints for the lid, so my chest is probably still several weeks in the
making, but the project is progressing well.

Since this is my first joint, I decided that large pins would be more forgiving.
Certainly 1/4" pins cut cleanly by an experienced craftsman look very neat, but I
am certainly not experienced and did not expect to cut the pins cleanly at the 
first attempt.  In the end, I settled on 1/2" pins (at the narrow end) and 1" tails
(at the wide end), so my 14" wide boards have ten pins or nine tails to join them.

I decided that the pins should be on the ends of the box, to resist pull-out from
the handles.  So the long boards will have the tails, and the first job was to
mark and cut these.  I made a small dovetail marking guage using the pattern in
'Modern Practical Joinery' by George Ellis (published 1902).  The angle is 1:6 
because the wood is soft. ...
