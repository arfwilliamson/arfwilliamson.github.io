I still only have a very limited selection of tools, but we are expecting the container to
arrive from South Africa soon, and when it does I want to start on a workbench.  Sawing on
the ground, across my knees, or over plastic garden chairs is difficult, and not very
accurate, so I would like to make some trestles or saw-horses.

Stud timber 1 1/2" x 2 1/2"
Followed instructions exactly, except that the slot in the sides of the main support plank were
slightly shallower.
