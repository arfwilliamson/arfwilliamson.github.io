title: Making panels

With the workbench usable, it is time to make something real.  I took a long walk
down the Basingstoke Canal to think of a project, and eventually settled on a big
wooden box.  It won't be a fantastically stylish piece, but it will be a chance to
learn something new.  Having decided on the project, I searched through blogs and
web pages for pictures and ideas, and discovered that a tool chest is a fairly 
common first project.  The basic concept is:

* A deep box, made from wide panels, dovetail-jointed together;
* A shallow lid, made for narrower panels;
* A bottom panel, made from short planks nailed or screwed to the bottom of the box; and
* A top panel, made from long planks rabbet jointed to the lid.

If I can, I would like to put a weatherproof edge between the box and the lid, and
concealed hinges, but that may be a bit of an over-reach.

The first thing needed is the panels for the box.  I haven't yet found a good, local,
timber merchant, so the panels are going to be laminated from the 2 1/2" x 1 1/2" 
studs that I can get cheaply and easily.  I started with the offcuts that I already
have, splitting them lengthwise with two cuts on the table-saw, planing the edges,
and gluing them together.  I don't have any long clamps, to I screwed some blocks
from scrap onto the ends of a few long battens, and tapped in some wedges until the 
glue squeezed out.  I left each panel clamped for a full day, so over the weekend I
managed to make two panels about 14" wide, and roughly 3' long.  The surfaces are 
very rough and will need to be planed smooth, but the joints look strong.  I am 
pleased with the result.
